		<h1>Image Types</h1>
		<p>This page depicts different image types<br></p>
		<h2>JPG</h2>
		<img src="./images/mochi/mochi.jpg" alt="Cute Bubble Mochi" height="300" width="300">
		<p>JPG images are designed for handling large color palettes without exorbitantly increasing file size.</p>
		<h2>GIF</h2>
		<img src="./images/mochi/mochi.gif" alt="Bouncing Mochi" height="300" width="300">
		<p>GIFs are the go-to option for simple animations, but the trade off is that they’re somewhat limited in terms
			of color
			palette—never use them for photos.</p>
		<h2>PNG</h2>
		<img src="./images/mochi/mochi.png" alt="Plain Mochi" height="300" width="300">
		<p>PNGs are great for anything that’s not a photo or animated. They do deal with opacity just fine, and they
			don’t have color palette limitations. This makes them an excellent fit for icons, technical diagrams, logos,
			etc.</p>
		<h2>SVG</h2>
		<img src="./images/mochi/mochi.svg" alt="Vector Mochi" height="300" width="300">
		<p>SVG is a vector-based graphics format, meaning it can scale up or down to any dimension without loss of
			quality. This
			property makes SVG images a wonderful tool for responsive design. They’re good for pretty much all the same
			use cases as
			PNGs, and you should use them whenever you can.</p>
